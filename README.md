TiccyTac is a delightful website that brings the classic game Tic Tac Toe to life. It is built with a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Let's dive into the details: 
Key Features 
Interactive Gameplay: Play Tic Tac Toe by challenging your friends. The game board is laid out neatly and players take turns marking X's or O's.
